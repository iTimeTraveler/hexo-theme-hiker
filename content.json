Among the initial research topics are: ‘Science, value and the future of intelligence’; ‘Policy and responsible innovation’; ‘Autonomous weapons – prospects for regulation’ and ‘Trust and transparency’. The Academic Director of the Centre, and Bertrand Russell Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge, Huw Price, said: “The creation of machine intelligence is likely to be a once-in-a-planet’s-lifetime event. It is a future we humans face together. Our aim is to build a broad community with the expertise and sense of common purpose to make this future the best it can be.” Many researchers now take seriously the possibility that intelligence equal to our own will be created in computers within this century. Freed of biological constraints, such as limited memory and slow biochemical processing speeds, machines may eventually become more intelligent than we are – with profound implications for us all. AI pioneer Professor Maggie Boden (University of Sussex) sits on the Centre’s advisory board and spoke at this evening’s launch. She said: “AI is hugely exciting. Its practical applications can help us to tackle important social problems, as well as easing many tasks in everyday life. And it has advanced the sciences of mind and life in fundamental ways. But it has limitations, which present grave dangers given uncritical use. CFI aims to pre-empt these dangers, by guiding AI development in human-friendly ways.” “Recent landmarks such as self-driving cars or a computer game winning at the game of Go, are signs of what’s to come,” added Professor Hawking. “The rise of powerful AI will either be the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. We do not yet know which. The research done by this centre is crucial to the future of our civilisation and of our species.” Transcript of Professor Hawking’s speech at the launch of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, October 19, 2016 “It is a great pleasure to be here today to open this new Centre. We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let’s face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it is a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. Intelligence is central to what it means to be human. Everything that our civilisation has achieved, is a product of human intelligence, from learning to master fire, to learning to grow food, to understanding the cosmos. I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer. It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence — and exceed it. Artificial intelligence research is now progressing rapidly. Recent landmarks such as self-driving cars, or a computer winning at the game of Go, are signs of what is to come. Enormous levels of investment are pouring into this technology. The achievements we have seen so far will surely pale against what the coming decades will bring. The potential benefits of creating intelligence are huge. We cannot predict what we might achieve, when our own minds are amplified by AI. Perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution, we will be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by the last one — industrialisation. And surely we will aim to finally eradicate disease and poverty. Every aspect of our lives will be transformed. In short, success in creating AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. But it could also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks. Alongside the benefits, AI will also bring dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It will bring great disruption to our economy. And in the future, AI could develop a will of its own — a will that is in conflict with ours. In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity. We do not yet know which. That is why in 2014, I and a few others called for more research to be done in this area. I am very glad that someone was listening to me! The research done by this centre is crucial to the future of our civilisation and of our species. I wish you the best of luck!” 以下为霍金演讲全文的中文版：今天，非常荣幸来来这里参加新中心的开启仪式。 我们花了大把的时间研究历史，让我们来直面这部历史，这近乎是部愚昧的历史。所以，人们现在转而研究未来的智慧了，这种转变将备受欢迎。 对人类而言，智慧是存在的核心所在。一切文明，皆是智慧的产物。从学会用火，到学会耕种，到理解宇宙。 我相信，生物的大脑所获得的智慧，与计算机所能获得的智慧，并无本质区别。因此，理论上，计算机可以模拟人类智慧，并超越它。 现在人工智能的研究日新月异。最新的标志性成果，比如自动驾驶汽车、阿尔法狗战胜围棋世界高手，预示着即将到来新的时代。大小额投资纷纷倾注于这个领域。我们迄今为止所见到的成就，在新时代面前，即将黯然失色。 人工智能的带来的益处是巨大的。我们无法预测，当人类心智被人工智能扩展时，我们会取得哪些成就。也许，有了这个技术革命的新工具，我们能够有能力弥补一些由工业化对自然界造成的破坏。当然，我们希望能够最终消灭疾病和贫穷。我们生活的方方面面都会被变化。简而言之，人工智能的成功创造，可以说是人类文明史上最大的事件。 但是，它也可能是人类文明史的终结，除非我们学会如何避免它所带来的危害。人工智能在带来益处的同时，也带来危险，比如强大的自动武器，或少数人欺压多数人的新方法。它也可能给我们的经济带来巨大的破坏。将来，人工智能可能会发展出来它自己的意志——一个与人类相冲突的意志。 总之，人工智能的强力崛起，在人类历史上，可能是最好的，也可能是最糟糕的。而我们尚且不知道会是哪一个。这是为什么在2014年，我和其它几个人呼吁在这个领域进行更多研究。令我欣慰的是，有人听到了我的呼声！ 这个中心的研究，对我们人类文明的将来，对我们人类这个物种而言，都是极其关键的。祝大家好运！","categories":[{"name":"AI","slug":"AI","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/categories/AI/"}],"tags":[],"keywords":[{"name":"AI","slug":"AI","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/categories/AI/"}]},{"title":"Hillary Clinton Calls for Unity in Concession Speech","slug":"Hillary Clinton Calls for Unity in Concession Speech","date":"2016-11-18T01:55:37.000Z","updated":"2017-08-01T10:53:04.749Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/18/Hillary Clinton Calls for Unity in Concession Speech/","link":"","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/hexo-theme-hiker/2016/11/18/Hillary Clinton Calls for Unity in Concession Speech/","excerpt":"Hillary Clinton delivered her concession speech this morning in New York City.

TRANSCRIPT:Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you so much. A very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much for being here. I love you all, too. Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together. This vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person, or even one election. It was about the country we love and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America, and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. We don’t just respect that. We cherish it. It also enshrines the rule of law; the principle we are all equal in rights and dignity; freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values, too, and we must defend them. Let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let’s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear. Making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet. And breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams. We spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone. For people of all races, and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It has been a joy get to go know them better and gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. We thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world. And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country, even 4-month-old Aidan, who traveled with his mom. I will always be grateful to the talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. You poured your hearts into this campaign. To some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to their neighbors, posted on Facebook — even in secret private Facebook sites. I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. To anyone that sent contributions, even as small as $5, that kept us going, thank you. To all of us, and to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this — I have, as Tim said, I have spent my entire life fighting for what I believe in. I’ve had successes and setbacks and sometimes painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, and political careers — you will have successes and setbacks too. This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it. It is, it is worth it. And so we need — we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me: I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will — and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. Finally, finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American, and I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strengthen our convictions, and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. Because, you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, let us not grow weary of doing good, for in good season we shall reap. My friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary and lose heart, for there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do. I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Obama added, “We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country.” President Barack Obama also held a press conference today in which he congratulated Trump on his victory and committed to a smooth transition of power. Obama said that he will meet with Trump at the White House on Thursday. He said that he is dedicated to ensuring a successful transition of power because that is how American democracy works. 演讲全文翻译谢谢你们。非常感谢大家。非常感谢。掌声很热烈。谢谢你们，我的朋友们。谢谢。谢谢。 谢谢大家来到这里。我也爱你们。昨天晚上，我向唐纳德·特朗普表示了祝贺，并表示愿意同他一起为我们的国家而奋斗。 我希望他能成为一名所有美国人心目中的成功总统。这份结果并非我们当初所愿或者拼搏至今的目标。我也很遗憾，我们没有凭借共有的价值观以及对这个国家未来的愿景而赢得这场选举。 对于我们亲手缔造的这场伟大竞选，我感到骄傲和感激。这场多元的、富有创造力的、活力四射的竞选活动。你们代表了美国最好的那个部分，能够做你们的候选人，是我一生中最大的荣耀之一。 我知道你们有多沮丧，因为我也一样。数千万将他们的希望和梦想投入这一努力的美国人也一样。这很痛苦，而且这种痛苦会持续很久。但是我希望你们能记住： 我们的竞选并非只关乎一个人，甚至也不只关乎一次选举。竞选是为了我们热爱的国家，为了缔造一个充满希望的、包容的和宽怀的美利坚。我们现在已经知道，这个国家远比我们想象的要更加分裂。但我仍然对美国充满信心，并将一直如此。如果你也同我一样，那我们就必须接受结果，面向未来。唐纳德·特朗普将要成为我们的总统，我们应当用开放的心胸去接纳他，给予他领导美国的机会。和平的权力交接正是我们的宪政民主一直标榜的。 我们不仅要尊重结果，我们要珍惜这个结果。它同样标榜了法治；标榜了权利和尊严平等的原则；信仰和表达的自由。我们尊重、珍惜这些价值，我们必须捍卫它们。 补充一句：在我们的宪政民主体制下，我们的参与不应只是四年一次的大选，而必须贯彻始终。所以，让我们继续尽己所能，推进我们所珍视的事业与价值：驱动我们的经济，为所有人服务，而不止是那些处在高位的人。保护我们的国家，保护我们的星球。 我们要打碎所有阻碍实现美国梦的藩篱。整整一年半的时间，我们将这个国家四面八方、数以百万计的人们团结在一起，发出同一个声音，因为我们相信，美国梦足够宏大，能够为所有人共享。无论的种族、宗教、性别，无论你是移民、LGBT人士还是残疾人士，你都可以拥有这份美国梦。 能够和你们所有人站在一起，我内心无比感激。我想感谢我的搭档蒂姆·凯恩和安妮·霍尔顿这一路的陪伴。 我享受和他们不断熟悉的过程，而蒂姆将担任弗吉尼亚州国会参议员、奋斗在民主一线的消息也给了我很多希望与慰藉。 对于奥巴马夫妇，整个国家欠你们一声由衷的感谢。 感谢你们的优雅风度、意志坚定的领导力，这对美国人民和世界各国人民都意义非凡。比尔、切尔西、马克、夏洛特、艾丹，我的兄弟们、家族的亲人们，我对你们的爱已经难以用言语表达。你们同我一起到过无数的地方竞选，甚至才4个月大的艾丹都要跟着妈妈奔波。我也对布鲁克林总部和全美其他竞选中心里那些智慧、忠诚的工作人员与志愿者们非常感激。 你们在竞选中倾入心血。有的人有着丰富竞选经验，在多次参与竞选后加入了团队，有的人是第一次参与竞选活动。我想让你们知道，你们是任何一个参选人能够期待的最棒的竞选人员。 成千上万的志愿者、社区领袖、活动认识、工会组织者们，你们努力敲门发动选民、与邻居们交谈、通过FB页面发消息——有时甚至是在一些私密页面中发声。 我希望你们能够从幕后走到台前来，发出你们的声音，确保你们的声音能够继续传播下去。 对于所有支持我们前行的捐款者，即便是5美元的金额，谢谢你们。所有人，尤其是年轻人，我希望你们能听到这一点：我的确，就像蒂姆说的那样，倾尽一生，为我的信仰而奋斗。 我有过成功也有挫折，有的时候，是很痛苦的挫折。你们当中的很多人，都处于职业的开端，无论是公共领域还是政治领域，你们也会遇到成功和挫折。这次的失败让人受伤，但是请不要停止相信：为正确的信念而奋斗，是值得的。的确，是值得的。 所以我们需要，我们需要你们继续这些奋斗，奋斗于当下，奋斗终生。同时，对所有将信念加诸这场竞选以及我身上的女性，特别是年轻女性们，我希望你们知道，没有什么比成为你们的捍卫者更让我感到骄傲的了。 我们还没有打破这层最高的和最坚硬的天花板玻璃，但是，有一天，有一个人会的。希望这一天要比我们现在觉得的，来得更早。 我想对所有在观看我演讲的小女孩们说，永远不要怀疑自己的价值和能力，你应该去抓住世界上每一次机会，去追求与实现自己的梦想。 最后，最后，我非常感谢我们的国家，以及它给予我的一切。 我每一天都感恩自己是一个美国人，而且我仍然和从前一样深信着，如果我们站在一起、共同奋斗，并尊重我们之间的分歧，不断强化我们对这个国家的信念和爱，最美好的日子仍会在未来等着我们。 因为，我相信我们在一起将变得更强大，而且我们必将一同前进。你永远、永远不应该对为此奋斗过而感到后悔。 圣经告诉我们：“不厌倦因为好的原因做好事，这样我们就会有收获。” 我的朋友们，让我们对彼此有信心，不要疲惫和灰心，因为还会有更多好的原因出现，更多的工作要做。 我非常荣幸和感激，能有机会在这次影响深远的选举中代表你们所有人。希望上帝保佑你们，希望上帝保佑美利坚合众国。 Source General

本指南的读者对象是所有对机器学习有求知欲但却不知道如何开头的朋友。我猜很多人已经读过了“机器学习” ——维基百科词条，倍感挫折，以为没人能给出一个高层次的解释。本文就是你们想要的东西。 本文目标在于平易近人，这意味着文中有大量的概括。但是谁在乎这些呢？只要能让读者对于ML更感兴趣，任务也就完成了。 何为机器学习？机器学习这个概念认为，对于待解问题，你无需编写任何专门的程序代码，遗传算法（generic algorithms）能够在数据集上为你得出有趣的答案。对于遗传算法，不用编码，而是将数据输入，它将在数据之上建立起它自己的逻辑。 举个例子，有一类算法称为分类算法，它可以将数据划分为不同的组别。一个用来识别手写数字的分类算法，不用修改一行代码，就可以用来将电子邮件分为垃圾邮件和普通邮件。算法没变，但是输入的训练数据变了，因此它得出了不同的分类逻辑。 机器学习算法是个黑盒，可以重用来解决很多不同的分类问题。 “机器学习”是一个涵盖性术语，覆盖了大量类似的遗传算法。 两类机器学习算法你可以认为机器学习算法分为两大类：监督式学习（Supervised Learning）和非监督式学习（Unsupervised Learning）。两者区别很简单，但却非常重要。 监督式学习假设你是一名房产经纪，生意越做越大，因此你雇了一批实习生来帮你。但是问题来了——你可以看一眼房子就知道它到底值多少钱，实习生没有经验，不知道如何估价。 为了帮助你的实习生（也许是为了解放你自己去度个假），你决定写个小软件，可以根据房屋大小、地段以及类似房屋的成交价等因素来评估你所在地区房屋的价值。 你把3个月来城里每笔房屋交易都写了下来，每一单你都记录了一长串的细节——卧室数量、房屋大小、地段等等。但最重要的是，你写下了最终的成交价： 这是我们的“训练数据”: 我们要利用这些训练数据来编写一个程序来估算该地区其他房屋的价值： 这就称为监督式学习。你已经知道每一栋房屋的售价，换句话说，你知道问题的答案，并可以反向找出解题的逻辑。 为了编写软件，你将包含每一套房产的训练数据输入你的机器学习算法。算法尝试找出应该使用何种运算来得出价格数字。 这就像是算术练习题，算式中的运算符号都被擦去了：天哪！一个阴险的学生将老师答案上的算术符号全擦去了。 看了这些题，你能明白这些测验里面是什么样的数学问题吗？你知道，你应该对算式左边的数字“做些什么”以得出算式右边的答案。 在监督式学习中，你是让计算机为你算出数字间的关系。而一旦你知道了解决这类特定问题所需要的数学方法后，你就可以解答同类的其它问题了。 非监督式学习让我们回到开头那个房地产经纪的例子。要是你不知道每栋房子的售价怎么办？即使你所知道的只是房屋的大小、位置等信息，你也可以搞出很酷的花样。这就是所谓的非监督式学习。 即使你不是想去预测未知的数据（如价格），你也可以运用机器学习完成一些有意思的事。 这就有点像有人给你一张纸，上面列出了很多数字，然后对你说:“我不知道这些数字有什么意义，也许你能从中找出规律或是能将它们分类，或是其它什么-祝你好运！” 你该怎么处理这些数据呢？首先，你可以用个算法自动地从数据中划分出不同的细分市场。也许你会发现大学附近的买房者喜欢户型小但卧室多的房子，而郊区的买房者偏好三卧室的大户型。这些信息可以直接帮助你的营销。 你还可以作件很酷的事，自动找出房价的离群数据，即与其它数据迥异的值。这些鹤立鸡群的房产也许是高楼大厦，而你可以将最优秀的推销员集中在这些地区，因为他们的佣金更高。 本文余下部分我们主要讨论监督式学习，但这并不是因为非监督式学习用处不大或是索然无味。实际上，随着算法改良，不用将数据和正确答案联系在一起，因此非监督式学习正变得越来越重要。 老学究请看:还有很多其它种类的机器学习算法。但初学时这样理解不错了。 太酷了，但是评估房价真能被看作“学习”吗？作为人类的一员，你的大脑可以应付绝大多数情况，并且没有任何明确指令也能够学习如何处理这些情况。如果你做房产经纪时间很长，你对于房产的合适定价、它的最佳营销方式以及哪些客户会感兴趣等等都会有一种本能般的“感觉”。强人工智能（Strong AI）研究的目标就是要能够用计算机复制这种能力。 但是目前的机器学习算法还没有那么好——它们只能专注于非常特定的、有限的问题。也许在这种情况下，“学习”更贴切的定义是“在少量范例数据的基础上找出一个等式来解决特定的问题”。 不幸的是，“机器在少量范例数据的基础上找出一个等式来解决特定的问题”这个名字太烂了。所以最后我们用“机器学习”取而代之。 当然，要是你是在50年之后来读这篇文章，那时我们已经得出了强人工智能算法，而本文看起来就像个老古董。未来的人类，你还是别读了，叫你的机器仆人给你做份三明治吧。 让我们写代码吧!前面例子中评估房价的程序，你打算怎么写呢？往下看之前，先思考一下吧。 如果你对机器学习一无所知，很有可能你会尝试写出一些基本规则来评估房价，如下： 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood): price = 0 # In my area, the average house costs $200 per sqft price_per_sqft = 200 if neighborhood == \"hipsterton\": # but some areas cost a bit more price_per_sqft = 400 elif neighborhood == \"skid row\": # and some areas cost less price_per_sqft = 100 # start with a base price estimate based on how big the place is price = price_per_sqft * sqft # now adjust our estimate based on the number of bedrooms if num_of_bedrooms == 0: # Studio apartments are cheap price = price — 20000 else: # places with more bedrooms are usually # more valuable price = price + (num_of_bedrooms * 1000) return price 假如你像这样瞎忙几个小时，也许会取得一点成效，但是你的程序永不会完美，而且当价格变化时很难维护。 如果能让计算机找出实现上述函数功能的办法，这样岂不更好？只要返回的房价数字正确，谁会在乎函数具体干了些什么呢？ 1234def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood): price = &lt;computer, plz do some math for me&gt; return price 考虑这个问题的一种角度是将房价看做一碗美味的汤，而汤中成分就是卧室数、面积和地段。如果你能算出每种成分对最终的价格有多大影响，也许就能得到各种成分混合起来形成最终价格的具体比例。 这样可以将你最初的程序（全是疯狂的if else语句）简化成类似如下的样子： 12345678910111213141516def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood): price = 0 # a little pinch of this price += num_of_bedrooms * .841231951398213 # and a big pinch of that price += sqft * 1231.1231231 # maybe a handful of this price += neighborhood * 2.3242341421 # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure price += 201.23432095 return price 请注意那些用粗体标注的神奇数字——.841231951398213, 1231.1231231,2.3242341421, 和201.23432095。它们称为权重。如果我们能找出对每栋房子都适用的完美权重，我们的函数就能预测所有的房价！ 找出最佳权重的一种笨办法如下所示： 步骤1：首先，将每个权重都设为1.0： 12345678910111213141516def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood): price = 0 # a little pinch of this price += num_of_bedrooms * 1.0 # and a big pinch of that price += sqft * 1.0 # maybe a handful of this price += neighborhood * 1.0 # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure price += 1.0 return price 步骤2：将每栋房产带入你的函数运算，检验估算值与正确价格的偏离程度： 运用你的程序预测房屋价格。 例如：上表中第一套房产实际成交价为25万美元，你的函数估价为17.8万，这一套房产你就差了7.2万。 再将你的数据集中的每套房产估价偏离值平方后求和。假设数据集中有500套房产交易，估价偏离值平方求和总计为86,123,373美元。这就反映了你的函数现在的“正确”程度。 现在，将总计值除以500，得到每套房产的估价偏离平均值。将这个平均误差值称为你函数的代价。 如果你能调整权重使得这个代价变为0，你的函数就完美了。它意味着，根据输入的数据，你的程序对每一笔房产交易的估价都是分毫不差。而这就是我们的目标——尝试不同的权重值以使代价尽可能的低。 步骤3：不断重复步骤2，尝试所有可能的权重值组合。哪一个组合使得代价最接近于0，它就是你要使用的，你只要找到了这样的组合，问题就得到了解决! 思想扰动时间这太简单了，对吧？想一想刚才你做了些什么。你取得了一些数据，将它们输入至三个通用的简单步骤中，最后你得到了一个可以对你所在区域的房屋进行估价的函数。房价网，要当心咯！但是下面的事实可能会扰乱你的思想： 1.过去40年来，很多领域（如语言学/翻译学）的研究表明，这种通用的“搅动数据汤”（我编造的词）式的学习算法已经胜过了需要利用真人明确规则的方法。机器学习的“笨”办法最终打败了人类专家。 2.你最后写出的函数真是笨，它甚至不知道什么是“面积”和“卧室数”。它知道的只是搅动，改变数字来得到正确的答案。 3.很可能你都不知道为何一组特殊的权重值能起效。所以你只是写出了一个你实际上并不理解却能证明的函数。 4.试想一下，你的程序里没有类似“面积”和“卧室数”这样的参数，而是接受了一组数字。假设每个数字代表了你车顶安装的摄像头捕捉的画面中的一个像素，再将预测的输出不称为“价格”而是叫做“方向盘转动度数”，这样你就得到了一个程序可以自动操纵你的汽车了！ 太疯狂了，对吧？ 步骤3中的“尝试每个数字”怎么回事？好吧，当然你不可能尝试所有可能的权重值来找到效果最好的组合。那可真要花很长时间，因为要尝试的数字可能无穷无尽。 为避免这种情况，数学家们找到了很多聪明的办法（比如Gradient descent算法）来快速找到优秀的权重值，而不需要尝试过多。下面是其中一种： 首先，写出一个简单的等式表示前述步骤2，这是你的代价函数： 接着，让我们将这同一个等式用机器学习的数学术语（现在你可以忽略它们）进行重写： θ表示当前的权重值。 J(θ) 意为“当前权重值对应的代价”。 这个等式表示我们的估价程序在当前权重值下偏离程度的大小。如果将所有赋给卧室数和面积的可能权重值以图形形式显示，我们会得到类似下图的图表： 代价函数的图形像一支碗。纵轴表示代价。 图中蓝色的最低点就是代价最低的地方——即我们的程序偏离最小。最高点意味着偏离最大。所以，如果我们能找到一组权重值带领我们到达图中的最低点，我们就找到了答案！ 因此，我们只需要调整权重值使我们在图上能向着最低点“走下坡路”。如果对于权重的细小调节能一直使我们保持向最低点移动，那么最终我们不用尝试太多权重值就能到达那里。 如果你还记得一点微积分的话，你也许记得如果你对一个函数求导，结果会告诉你函数在任一点的斜率。换句话说，对于图上给定一点，它告诉我们那条路是下坡路。我们可以利用这一点朝底部进发。 所以，如果我们对代价函数关于每一个权重求偏导，那么我们就可以从每一个权重中减去该值。这样可以让我们更加接近山底。一直这样做，最终我们将到达底部，得到权重的最优值。（读不懂？不用担心，接着往下读）。 这种找出最佳权重的办法被称为批量梯度下降，上面是对它的高度概括。如果想搞懂细节，不要害怕，继续深入下去吧。 当你使用机器学习算法库来解决实际问题，所有这些都已经为你准备好了。但明白一些具体细节总是有用的。 还有什么你随便就略过了？上面我描述的三步算法被称为多元线性回归。你估算等式是在求一条能够拟合所有房价数据点的直线。然后，你再根据房价在你的直线上可能出现的位置用这个等式来估算从未见过的房屋的价格。这个想法威力强大，可以用它来解决“实际”问题。 但是，我为你展示的这种方法可能在简单的情况下有效，它不会在所有情况下都有用。原因之一是因为房价不会一直那么简单地跟随一条连续直线。 但是，幸运的是，有很多办法来处理这种情况。对于非线性数据，很多其他类型的机器学习算法可以处理（如神经网络或有核向量机）。还有很多方法运用线性回归更灵活，想到了用更复杂的线条来拟合。在所有的情况中，寻找最优权重值这一基本思路依然适用。 还有，我忽略了过拟合的概念。很容易碰上这样一组权重值，它们对于你原始数据集中的房价都能完美预测，但对于原始数据集之外的任何新房屋都预测不准。这种情况的解决之道也有不少（如正则化以及使用交叉验证数据集）。学会如何处理这一问题对于顺利应用机器学习至关重要。 换言之，基本概念非常简单，要想运用机器学习得到有用的结果还需要一些技巧和经验。但是，这是每个开发者都能学会的技巧。 机器学习法力无边吗？一旦你开始明白机器学习技术很容易应用于解决貌似很困难的问题（如手写识别），你心中会有一种感觉，只要有足够的数据，你就能够用机器学习解决任何问题。只需要将数据输入进去，就能看到计算机变戏法一样找出拟合数据的等式。 但是很重要的一点你要记住，机器学习只能对用你占有的数据实际可解的问题才适用。 例如，如果你建立了一个模型来根据每套房屋内盆栽数量来预测房价，它就永远不会成功。房屋内盆栽数量和房价之间没有任何的关系。所以，无论它怎么去尝试，计算机也推导不出两者之间的关系。 你只能对实际存在的关系建模。 怎样深入学习机器学习我认为，当前机器学习的最大问题是它主要活跃于学术界和商业研究组织中。对于圈外想要有个大体了解而不是想成为专家的人们，简单易懂的学习资料不多。但是这一情况每一天都在改善。 吴恩达教授（Andrew Ng）在Coursera上的机器学习免费课程非常不错。我强烈建议由此入门。任何拥有计算机科学学位、还能记住一点点数学的人应该都能理解。 另外，你还可以下载安装SciKit-Learn，用它来试验成千上万的机器学习算法。它是一个python框架，对于所有的标准算法都有“黑盒”版本。","categories":[{"name":"Machine

摘要HashMap是Java程序员使用频率最高的用于映射(键值对)处理的数据类型。随着JDK（Java Developmet Kit）版本的更新，JDK1.8对HashMap底层的实现进行了优化，例如引入红黑树的数据结构和扩容的优化等。本文结合JDK1.7和JDK1.8的区别，深入探讨HashMap的结构实现和功能原理。 简介Java为数据结构中的映射定义了一个接口java.util.Map，此接口主要有四个常用的实现类，分别是HashMap、Hashtable、LinkedHashMap和TreeMap，类继承关系如下图所示： 下面针对各个实现类的特点做一些说明： (1) HashMap：它根据键的hashCode值存储数据，大多数情况下可以直接定位到它的值，因而具有很快的访问速度，但遍历顺序却是不确定的。 HashMap最多只允许一条记录的键为null，允许多条记录的值为null。HashMap非线程安全，即任一时刻可以有多个线程同时写HashMap，可能会导致数据的不一致。如果需要满足线程安全，可以用 Collections的synchronizedMap方法使HashMap具有线程安全的能力，或者使用ConcurrentHashMap。 (2) Hashtable：Hashtable是遗留类，很多映射的常用功能与HashMap类似，不同的是它承自Dictionary类，并且是线程安全的，任一时间只有一个线程能写Hashtable，并发性不如ConcurrentHashMap，因为ConcurrentHashMap引入了分段锁。Hashtable不建议在新代码中使用，不需要线程安全的场合可以用HashMap替换，需要线程安全的场合可以用ConcurrentHashMap替换。 (3) LinkedHashMap：LinkedHashMap是HashMap的一个子类，保存了记录的插入顺序，在用Iterator遍历LinkedHashMap时，先得到的记录肯定是先插入的，也可以在构造时带参数，按照访问次序排序。 (4) TreeMap：TreeMap实现SortedMap接口，能够把它保存的记录根据键排序，默认是按键值的升序排序，也可以指定排序的比较器，当用Iterator遍历TreeMap时，得到的记录是排过序的。如果使用排序的映射，建议使用TreeMap。在使用TreeMap时，key必须实现Comparable接口或者在构造TreeMap传入自定义的Comparator，否则会在运行时抛出java.lang.ClassCastException类型的异常。 对于上述四种Map类型的类，要求映射中的key是不可变对象。不可变对象是该对象在创建后它的哈希值不会被改变。如果对象的哈希值发生变化，Map对象很可能就定位不到映射的位置了。 通过上面的比较，我们知道了HashMap是Java的Map家族中一个普通成员，鉴于它可以满足大多数场景的使用条件，所以是使用频度最高的一个。下文我们主要结合源码，从存储结构、常用方法分析、扩容以及安全性等方面深入讲解HashMap的工作原理。 内部实现搞清楚HashMap，首先需要知道HashMap是什么，即它的存储结构-字段；其次弄明白它能干什么，即它的功能实现-方法。下面我们针对这两个方面详细展开讲解。 存储结构-字段从结构实现来讲，HashMap是数组+链表+红黑树（JDK1.8增加了红黑树部分）实现的，如下如所示。 这里需要讲明白两个问题：数据底层具体存储的是什么？这样的存储方式有什么？优点呢？ (1) 从源码可知，HashMap类中有一个非常重要的字段，就是 Node[] table，即哈希桶数组，明显它是一个Node的数组。我们来看Node[JDK1.8]是何物。 1234567891011121314static class Node&lt;K,V&gt; implements Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; &#123; final int hash; //用来定位数组索引位置 final K key; V value; Node&lt;K,V&gt; next; //链表的下一个node Node(int hash, K key, V value, Node&lt;K,V&gt; next) &#123; ... &#125; public final K getKey()&#123; ... &#125; public final V getValue() &#123; ... &#125; public final String toString() &#123; ... &#125; public final int hashCode() &#123; ... &#125; public final V setValue(V newValue) &#123; ... &#125; public final boolean equals(Object o) &#123; ... &#125;&#125; Node是HashMap的一个内部类，实现了Map.Entry接口，本质是就是一个映射(键值对)。上图中的每个黑色圆点就是一个Node对象。 (2) HashMap就是使用哈希表来存储的。哈希表为解决冲突，可以采用开放地址法和链地址法等来解决问题，Java中HashMap采用了链地址法。链地址法，简单来说，就是数组加链表的结合。在每个数组元素上都一个链表结构，当数据被Hash后，得到数组下标，把数据放在对应下标元素的链表上。例如程序执行下面代码： 1map.put(\"美团\",\"小美\"); 系统将调用”美团”这个key的hashCode()方法得到其hashCode 值（该方法适用于每个Java对象），然后再通过Hash算法的后两步运算（高位运算和取模运算，下文有介绍）来定位该键值对的存储位置，有时两个key会定位到相同的位置，表示发生了Hash碰撞。当然Hash算法计算结果越分散均匀，Hash碰撞的概率就越小，map的存取效率就会越高。 如果哈希桶数组很大，即使较差的Hash算法也会比较分散，如果哈希桶数组数组很小，即使好的Hash算法也会出现较多碰撞，所以就需要在空间成本和时间成本之间权衡，其实就是在根据实际情况确定哈希桶数组的大小，并在此基础上设计好的hash算法减少Hash碰撞。那么通过什么方式来控制map使得Hash碰撞的概率又小，哈希桶数组（Node[] table）占用空间又少呢？答案就是好的Hash算法和扩容机制。 在理解Hash和扩容流程之前，我们得先了解下HashMap的几个字段。从HashMap的默认构造函数源码可知，构造函数就是对下面几个字段进行初始化，源码如下： 1234int threshold; // 所能容纳的key-value对极限 final float loadFactor; // 负载因子int modCount; int size; 首先，Node[] table的初始化长度length(默认值是16)，Load factor为负载因子(默认值是0.75)，threshold是HashMap所能容纳的最大数据量的Node(键值对)个数。threshold = length * Load factor。也就是说，在数组定义好长度之后，负载因子越大，所能容纳的键值对个数越多。 结合负载因子的定义公式可知，threshold就是在此Load factor和length(数组长度)对应下允许的最大元素数目，超过这个数目就重新resize(扩容)，扩容后的HashMap容量是之前容量的两倍。默认的负载因子0.75是对空间和时间效率的一个平衡选择，建议大家不要修改，除非在时间和空间比较特殊的情况下，如果内存空间很多而又对时间效率要求很高，可以降低负载因子Load factor的值；相反，如果内存空间紧张而对时间效率要求不高，可以增加负载因子loadFactor的值，这个值可以大于1。 size这个字段其实很好理解，就是HashMap中实际存在的键值对数量。注意和table的长度length、容纳最大键值对数量threshold的区别。而modCount字段主要用来记录HashMap内部结构发生变化的次数，主要用于迭代的快速失败。强调一点，内部结构发生变化指的是结构发生变化，例如put新键值对，但是某个key对应的value值被覆盖不属于结构变化。 在HashMap中，哈希桶数组table的长度length大小必须为2的n次方(一定是合数)，这是一种非常规的设计，常规的设计是把桶的大小设计为素数。相对来说素数导致冲突的概率要小于合数，具体证明可以参考http://blog.csdn.net/liuqiyao_01/article/details/14475159 ，Hashtable初始化桶大小为11，就是桶大小设计为素数的应用（Hashtable扩容后不能保证还是素数）。HashMap采用这种非常规设计，主要是为了在取模和扩容时做优化，同时为了减少冲突，HashMap定位哈希桶索引位置时，也加入了高位参与运算的过程。 这里存在一个问题，即使负载因子和Hash算法设计的再合理，也免不了会出现拉链过长的情况，一旦出现拉链过长，则会严重影响HashMap的性能。于是，在JDK1.8版本中，对数据结构做了进一步的优化，引入了红黑树。而当链表长度太长（默认超过8）时，链表就转换为红黑树，利用红黑树快速增删改查的特点提高HashMap的性能，其中会用到红黑树的插入、删除、查找等算法。本文不再对红黑树展开讨论，想了解更多红黑树数据结构的工作原理可以参考http://blog.csdn.net/v_july_v/article/details/6105630 。 功能实现-方法HashMap的内部功能实现很多，本文主要从根据key获取哈希桶数组索引位置、put方法的详细执行、扩容过程三个具有代表性的点深入展开讲解。 1. 确定哈希桶数组索引位置不管增加、删除、查找键值对，定位到哈希桶数组的位置都是很关键的第一步。前面说过HashMap的数据结构是数组和链表的结合，所以我们当然希望这个HashMap里面的元素位置尽量分布均匀些，尽量使得每个位置上的元素数量只有一个，那么当我们用hash算法求得这个位置的时候，马上就可以知道对应位置的元素就是我们要的，不用遍历链表，大大优化了查询的效率。HashMap定位数组索引位置，直接决定了hash方法的离散性能。先看看源码的实现(方法一+方法二): 1234567891011方法一：static final int hash(Object key) &#123; //jdk1.8 &amp; jdk1.7 int h; // h = key.hashCode() 为第一步 取hashCode值 // h ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) 为第二步 高位参与运算 return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 16);&#125;方法二：static int indexFor(int h, int length) &#123; //jdk1.7的源码，jdk1.8没有这个方法，但是实现原理一样的 return h &amp; (length-1); //第三步 取模运算&#125; 这里的Hash算法本质上就是三步：取key的hashCode值、高位运算、取模运算。 对于任意给定的对象，只要它的hashCode()返回值相同，那么程序调用方法一所计算得到的Hash码值总是相同的。我们首先想到的就是把hash值对数组长度取模运算，这样一来，元素的分布相对来说是比较均匀的。但是，模运算的消耗还是比较大的，在HashMap中是这样做的：调用方法二来计算该对象应该保存在table数组的哪个索引处。 这个方法非常巧妙，它通过h &amp; (table.length -1)来得到该对象的保存位，而HashMap底层数组的长度总是2的n次方，这是HashMap在速度上的优化。当length总是2的n次方时，h&amp; (length-1)运算等价于对length取模，也就是h%length，但是&amp;比%具有更高的效率。 在JDK1.8的实现中，优化了高位运算的算法，通过hashCode()的高16位异或低16位实现的：(h = k.hashCode()) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 16)，主要是从速度、功效、质量来考虑的，这么做可以在数组table的length比较小的时候，也能保证考虑到高低Bit都参与到Hash的计算中，同时不会有太大的开销。 下面举例说明下，n为table的长度。 2. 分析HashMap的put方法HashMap的put方法执行过程可以通过下图来理解，自己有兴趣可以去对比源码更清楚地研究学习。 ①. 判断键值对数组table[i]是否为空或为null，否则执行resize()进行扩容； ②. 根据键值key计算hash值得到插入的数组索引i，如果table[i]==null，直接新建节点添加，转向⑥，如果table[i]不为空，转向③； ③. 判断table[i]的首个元素是否和key一样，如果相同直接覆盖value，否则转向④，这里的相同指的是hashCode以及equals； ④. 判断table[i] 是否为treeNode，即table[i] 是否是红黑树，如果是红黑树，则直接在树中插入键值对，否则转向⑤； ⑤. 遍历table[i]，判断链表长度是否大于8，大于8的话把链表转换为红黑树，在红黑树中执行插入操作，否则进行链表的插入操作；遍历过程中若发现key已经存在直接覆盖value即可； ⑥. 插入成功后，判断实际存在的键值对数量size是否超多了最大容量threshold，如果超过，进行扩容。 JDK1.8HashMap的put方法源码如下: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556public V put(K key, V value) &#123; // 对key的hashCode()做hash return putVal(hash(key), key, value, false, true);&#125;final V putVal(int hash, K key, V value, boolean onlyIfAbsent, boolean evict) &#123; Node&lt;K,V&gt;[] tab; Node&lt;K,V&gt; p; int n, i; // 步骤①：tab为空则创建 if ((tab = table) == null || (n = tab.length) == 0) n = (tab = resize()).length; // 步骤②：计算index，并对null做处理 if ((p = tab[i = (n - 1) &amp; hash]) == null) tab[i] = newNode(hash, key, value, null); else &#123; Node&lt;K,V&gt; e; K k; // 步骤③：节点key存在，直接覆盖value if (p.hash == hash &amp;&amp; ((k = p.key) == key || (key != null &amp;&amp; key.equals(k)))) e = p; // 步骤④：判断该链为红黑树 else if (p instanceof TreeNode) e = ((TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt;)p).putTreeVal(this, tab, hash, key, value); // 步骤⑤：该链为链表 else &#123; for (int binCount = 0; ; ++binCount) &#123; if ((e = p.next) == null) &#123; p.next = newNode(hash, key,value,null); //链表长度大于8转换为红黑树进行处理 if (binCount &gt;= TREEIFY_THRESHOLD - 1) // -1 for 1st treeifyBin(tab, hash); break; &#125; // key已经存在直接覆盖value if (e.hash == hash &amp;&amp; ((k = e.key) == key || (key != null &amp;&amp; key.equals(k)))) break; p = e; &#125; &#125; if (e != null) &#123; // existing mapping for key V oldValue = e.value; if (!onlyIfAbsent || oldValue == null) e.value = value; afterNodeAccess(e); return oldValue; &#125; &#125; ++modCount; // 步骤⑥：超过最大容量 就扩容 if (++size &gt; threshold) resize(); afterNodeInsertion(evict); return null;&#125; 3. 扩容机制扩容(resize)就是重新计算容量，向HashMap对象里不停的添加元素，而HashMap对象内部的数组无法装载更多的元素时，对象就需要扩大数组的长度，以便能装入更多的元素。当然Java里的数组是无法自动扩容的，方法是使用一个新的数组代替已有的容量小的数组，就像我们用一个小桶装水，如果想装更多的水，就得换大水桶。 我们分析下resize的源码，鉴于JDK1.8融入了红黑树，较复杂，为了便于理解我们仍然使用JDK1.7的代码，好理解一些，本质上区别不大，具体区别后文再说。 12345678910111213void resize(int newCapacity) &#123; //传入新的容量 Entry[] oldTable = table; //引用扩容前的Entry数组 int oldCapacity = oldTable.length; if (oldCapacity == MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) &#123; //扩容前的数组大小如果已经达到最大(2^30)了 threshold = Integer.MAX_VALUE; //修改阈值为int的最大值(2^31-1)，这样以后就不会扩容了 return; &#125; Entry[] newTable = new Entry[newCapacity]; //初始化一个新的Entry数组 transfer(newTable); //！！将数据转移到新的Entry数组里 table = newTable; //HashMap的table属性引用新的Entry数组 threshold = (int)(newCapacity * loadFactor);//修改阈值&#125; 这里就是使用一个容量更大的数组来代替已有的容量小的数组，transfer()方法将原有Entry数组的元素拷贝到新的Entry数组里。 1234567891011121314151617void transfer(Entry[] newTable) &#123; Entry[] src = table; //src引用了旧的Entry数组 int newCapacity = newTable.length; for (int j = 0; j &lt; src.length; j++) &#123; //遍历旧的Entry数组 Entry&lt;K,V&gt; e = src[j]; //取得旧Entry数组的每个元素 if (e != null) &#123; src[j] = null;//释放旧Entry数组的对象引用（for循环后，旧的Entry数组不再引用任何对象） do &#123; Entry&lt;K,V&gt; next = e.next; int i = indexFor(e.hash, newCapacity); //！！重新计算每个元素在数组中的位置 e.next = newTable[i]; //标记[1] newTable[i] = e; //将元素放在数组上 e = next; //访问下一个Entry链上的元素 &#125; while (e != null); &#125; &#125;&#125; newTable[i]的引用赋给了e.next，也就是使用了单链表的头插入方式，同一位置上新元素总会被放在链表的头部位置；这样先放在一个索引上的元素终会被放到Entry链的尾部(如果发生了hash冲突的话），这一点和Jdk1.8有区别，下文详解。在旧数组中同一条Entry链上的元素，通过重新计算索引位置后，有可能被放到了新数组的不同位置上。 下面举个例子说明下扩容过程。假设了我们的hash算法就是简单的用key mod 一下表的大小（也就是数组的长度）。其中的哈希桶数组table的size=2， 所以key = 3、7、5，put顺序依次为 5、7、3。在mod 2以后都冲突在table[1]这里了。这里假设负载因子 loadFactor=1，即当键值对的实际大小size 大于 table的实际大小时进行扩容。接下来的三个步骤是哈希桶数组 resize成4，然后所有的Node重新rehash的过程。 下面我们讲解下JDK1.8做了哪些优化。经过观测可以发现，我们使用的是2次幂的扩展(指长度扩为原来2倍)，所以，元素的位置要么是在原位置，要么是在原位置再移动2次幂的位置。看下图可以明白这句话的意思，n为table的长度，图（a）表示扩容前的key1和key2两种key确定索引位置的示例，图（b）表示扩容后key1和key2两种key确定索引位置的示例，其中hash1是key1对应的哈希与高位运算结果。 元素在重新计算hash之后，因为n变为2倍，那么n-1的mask范围在高位多1bit(红色)，因此新的index就会发生这样的变化： 因此，我们在扩充HashMap的时候，不需要像JDK1.7的实现那样重新计算hash，只需要看看原来的hash值新增的那个bit是1还是0就好了，是0的话索引没变，是1的话索引变成“原索引+oldCap”，可以看看下图为16扩充为32的resize示意图： 这个设计确实非常的巧妙，既省去了重新计算hash值的时间，而且同时，由于新增的1bit是0还是1可以认为是随机的，因此resize的过程，均匀的把之前的冲突的节点分散到新的bucket了。这一块就是JDK1.8新增的优化点。有一点注意区别，JDK1.7中rehash的时候，旧链表迁移新链表的时候，如果在新表的数组索引位置相同，则链表元素会倒置，但是从上图可以看出，JDK1.8不会倒置。有兴趣的同学可以研究下JDK1.8的resize源码，写的很赞，如下: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182final Node&lt;K,V&gt;[] resize() &#123;

// 把每个bucket都移动到新的buckets中 for (int j = 0; j &lt; oldCap; ++j) &#123; Node&lt;K,V&gt; e; if ((e = oldTab[j]) != null) &#123; oldTab[j] = null; if (e.next == null) newTab[e.hash &amp; (newCap - 1)] = e; else if (e instanceof TreeNode) ((TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt;)e).split(this, newTab, j, oldCap); else &#123; // 链表优化重hash的代码块 Node&lt;K,V&gt; loHead = null, loTail = null; Node&lt;K,V&gt; hiHead = null, hiTail = null; Node&lt;K,V&gt; next; do &#123; next = e.next; // 原索引 if ((e.hash &amp; oldCap) == 0) &#123; if (loTail == null) loHead = e; else loTail.next = e; loTail = e; &#125; // 原索引+oldCap else &#123; if (hiTail == null) hiHead = e; else hiTail.next = e; hiTail = e; &#125; &#125; while ((e = next) != null); // 原索引放到bucket里 if (loTail != null) &#123; loTail.next = null; newTab[j] = loHead; &#125; // 原索引+oldCap放到bucket里 if (hiTail != null) &#123; hiTail.next = null; newTab[j + oldCap] = hiHead; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; return newTab;&#125; 线程安全性在多线程使用场景中，应该尽量避免使用线程不安全的HashMap，而使用线程安全的ConcurrentHashMap。那么为什么说HashMap是线程不安全的，下面举例子说明在并发的多线程使用场景中使用HashMap可能造成死循环。代码例子如下(便于理解，仍然使用JDK1.7的环境)： 1234567891011121314151617181920public class HashMapInfiniteLoop &#123; private static HashMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer,String&gt;(2, 0.75f); public static void main(String[] args) &#123; map.put(5, \"C\"); new Thread(\"Thread1\") &#123; public void run() &#123; map.put(7, \"B\"); System.out.println(map); &#125;; &#125;.start(); new Thread(\"Thread2\") &#123; public void run() &#123; map.put(3, \"A); System.out.println(map); &#125;; &#125;.start(); &#125; &#125; 其中，map初始化为一个长度为2的数组，loadFactor=0.75，threshold=2*0.75=1，也就是说当put第二个key的时候，map就需要进行resize。 通过设置断点让线程1和线程2同时debug到transfer方法(3.3小节代码块)的首行。注意此时两个线程已经成功添加数据。放开thread1的断点至transfer方法的“Entry next = e.next;” 这一行；然后放开线程2的的断点，让线程2进行resize。结果如下图。 注意，Thread1的 e 指向了key(3)，而next指向了key(7)，其在线程二rehash后，指向了线程二重组后的链表。 线程一被调度回来执行，先是执行 newTalbe[i] = e， 然后是e = next，导致了e指向了key(7)，而下一次循环的next = e.next导致了next指向了key(3)。 e.next = newTable[i] 导致 key(3).next 指向了 key(7)。注意：此时的key(7).next 已经指向了key(3)， 环形链表就这样出现了。 于是，当我们用线程一调用map.get(11)时，悲剧就出现了——Infinite Loop。 JDK1.8与JDK1.7的性能对比HashMap中，如果key经过hash算法得出的数组索引位置全部不相同，即Hash算法非常好，那样的话，getKey方法的时间复杂度就是O(1)，如果Hash算法技术的结果碰撞非常多，假如Hash算极其差，所有的Hash算法结果得出的索引位置一样，那样所有的键值对都集中到一个桶中，或者在一个链表中，或者在一个红黑树中，时间复杂度分别为O(n)和O(lgn)。 鉴于JDK1.8做了多方面的优化，总体性能优于JDK1.7，下面我们从两个方面用例子证明这一点。 Hash较均匀的情况为了便于测试，我们先写一个类Key，如下： 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627class Key implements Comparable&lt;Key&gt; &#123; private final int value; Key(int value) &#123; this.value = value; &#125; @Override public int compareTo(Key o) &#123; return Integer.compare(this.value, o.value); &#125; @Override public boolean equals(Object o) &#123; if (this == o) return true; if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; Key key = (Key) o; return value == key.value; &#125; @Override public int hashCode() &#123; return value; &#125;&#125; 这个类复写了equals方法，并且提供了相当好的hashCode函数，任何一个值的hashCode都不会相同，因为直接使用value当做hashcode。为了避免频繁的GC，我将不变的Key实例缓存了起来，而不是一遍一遍的创建它们。代码如下： 123456789101112131415public class Keys &#123; public static final int MAX_KEY = 10_000_000; private static final Key[] KEYS_CACHE = new Key[MAX_KEY]; static &#123; for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_KEY; ++i) &#123; KEYS_CACHE[i] = new Key(i); &#125; &#125; public static Key of(int value) &#123; return KEYS_CACHE[value]; &#125;&#125; 现在开始我们的试验，测试需要做的仅仅是，创建不同size的HashMap（1、10、100、……10000000），屏蔽了扩容的情况，代码如下： 1234567891011121314151617181920static void test(int mapSize) &#123; HashMap&lt;Key, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Key,Integer&gt;(mapSize); for (int i = 0; i &lt; mapSize; ++i) &#123; map.put(Keys.of(i), i); &#125; long beginTime = System.nanoTime(); //获取纳秒 for (int i = 0; i &lt; mapSize; i++) &#123; map.get(Keys.of(i)); &#125; long endTime = System.nanoTime(); System.out.println(endTime - beginTime); &#125; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; for(int i=10;i&lt;= 1000 0000;i*= 10)&#123; test(i); &#125; &#125; 在测试中会查找不同的值，然后度量花费的时间，为了计算getKey的平均时间，我们遍历所有的get方法，计算总的时间，除以key的数量，计算一个平均值，主要用来比较，绝对值可能会受很多环境因素的影响。结果如下： 通过观测测试结果可知，JDK1.8的性能要高于JDK1.7 15%以上，在某些size的区域上，甚至高于100%。由于Hash算法较均匀，JDK1.8引入的红黑树效果不明显，下面我们看看Hash不均匀的的情况。 Hash极不均匀的情况假设我们又一个非常差的Key，它们所有的实例都返回相同的hashCode值。这是使用HashMap最坏的情况。代码修改如下： 123456789class Key implements Comparable&lt;Key&gt; &#123; //... @Override public int hashCode() &#123; return 1; &#125;&#125; 仍然执行main方法，得出的结果如下表所示： 从表中结果中可知，随着size的变大，JDK1.7的花费时间是增长的趋势，而JDK1.8是明显的降低趋势，并且呈现对数增长稳定。当一个链表太长的时候，HashMap会动态的将它替换成一个红黑树，这话的话会将时间复杂度从O(n)降为O(logn)。hash算法均匀和不均匀所花费的时间明显也不相同，这两种情况的相对比较，可以说明一个好的hash算法的重要性。 测试环境：处理器为2.2 GHz Intel Core i7，内存为16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3，SSD硬盘，使用默认的JVM参数，运行在64位的OS X 10.10.1上。 小结(1) 扩容是一个特别耗性能的操作，所以当程序员在使用HashMap的时候，估算map的大小，初始化的时候给一个大致的数值，避免map进行频繁的扩容。 (2) 负载因子是可以修改的，也可以大于1，但是建议不要轻易修改，除非情况非常特殊。 (3) HashMap是线程不安全的，不要在并发的环境中同时操作HashMap，建议使用ConcurrentHashMap。 (4) JDK1.8引入红黑树大程度优化了HashMap的性能。 (5) 还没升级JDK1.8的，现在开始升级吧。HashMap的性能提升仅仅是JDK1.8的冰山一角。 参考 JDK1.7&amp;JDK1.8 源码。 酷壳COOLSHELL，疫苗：JAVA HASHMAP的死循环，2013 CSDN博客频道，HashMap多线程死循环问题，2014。 红黑联盟，Java类集框架之HashMap(JDK1.8)源码剖析，2015。 CSDN博客频道， 教你初步了解红黑树，2010。 Java Code Geeks，HashMap performance improvements in Java 8，2014。 Importnew，危险！在HashMap中将可变对象用作Key，2014。 CSDN博客频道，为什么一般hashtable的桶数会取一个素数，2013。","categories":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/categories/Java/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/tags/Java/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/categories/Java/"}]},{"title":"Gallery Example","slug":"Gallery-Example","date":"2016-01-26T13:55:37.000Z","updated":"2016-11-09T03:10:33.536Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/01/26/Gallery-Example/","link":"","permalink":"https://itimetraveler.github.io/hexo-theme-hiker/2016/01/26/Gallery-Example/","excerpt":"To add a photo gallery placeholder to your post, just add the following lines to your front-matter:1234photos:- https://www.hdwallpapers.net/previews/starry-night-over-corsica-986.jpg- https://www.hdwallpapers.net/previews/water-plant-close-up-979.jpg- ...","text":"To add a photo gallery placeholder to your post, just add the following lines to your front-matter:1234photos:- https://www.hdwallpapers.net/previews/starry-night-over-corsica-986.jpg- https://www.hdwallpapers.net/previews/water-plant-close-up-979.jpg- ... and enable lightgallery plugin in your _config.yml:12345# Pluginsplugins:+ lightgallery: true # options: true, false google_analytics: # enter the tracking ID for your Google Analytics ...

UnorderedHTML Tag: &lt;ul&gt; Unordered lists use asterisks (*), pluses (+), and hyphens (-). Code: * Red * Green * Blue Preview: Red Green Blue is equivalent to: Code: + Red + Green + Blue and: Code: - Red - Green - Blue OrderedHTML Tag: &lt;ol&gt; Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods: Code: 1. Bird 2. McHale 3. Parish Preview: Bird McHale Parish It’s possible to trigger an ordered list by accident, by writing something like this: Code: 1986. What a great season. Preview: What a great season. You can backslash-escape (\\) the period: Code: 1986\\. What a great season. Preview: 1986. What a great season. IndentedBlockquoteTo put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote’s &gt; delimiters need to be indented: Code: * A list item with a blockquote: &gt; This is a blockquote &gt; inside a list item.

Code BlockTo put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented twice — 8 spaces or two tabs: Code: * A list item with a code block: &lt;code goes here&gt; Preview: A list item with a code block: &lt;code goes here&gt; Nested ListCode: * A * A1 * A2 * B * C Preview: A A1 A2 B C Code BlocksHTML Tag: &lt;pre&gt; Indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. Code: This is a normal paragraph: This is a code block. Preview: This is a normal paragraph: This is a code block. A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article). Within a code block, ampersands (&amp;) and angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) are automatically converted into HTML entities. Code: &lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt; &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation &lt;/div&gt; Preview: &lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt; &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation &lt;/div&gt; Following sections Fenced Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting are extensions, you can use the other way to write the code block. Fenced Code BlocksJust wrap your code in ``` (as shown below) and you won’t need to indent it by four spaces. Code: Here&apos;s an example: 123function test() &#123; console.log(&quot;notice the blank line before this function?&quot;);&#125; Preview: Here’s an example: 123function test() &#123; console.log(&quot;notice the blank line before this function?&quot;);&#125; Syntax HighlightingIn your fenced block, add an optional language identifier and we’ll run it through syntax highlighting (Support Languages). Code: 123require 'redcarpet'markdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")puts markdown.to_html Preview: 123require 'redcarpet'markdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")puts markdown.to_html Horizontal RulesHTML Tag: &lt;hr /&gt;Places three or more hyphens (-), asterisks (*), or underscores (_) on a line by themselves. You may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Code: * * * *** ***** - - - --------------------------------------- ___ Preview: - - - TableHTML Tag: &lt;table&gt; It’s an extension. Separates column by pipe (|) and header by dashes (-), and uses colon (:) for alignment. The outer pipes (|) and alignment are optional. There are 3 delimiters each cell at least for separating header. Code:12345678910111213| Left | Center | Right ||:-----|:------:|------:||aaa |bbb |ccc ||ddd |eee |fff | A | B---|---123|456A |B--|--12|45 Preview: Left Center Right aaa bbb ccc ddd eee fff A B 123 456 A B 12 45 Span ElementsLinksHTML Tag: &lt;a&gt; Markdown supports two style of links: inline and reference. InlineInline link format like this: [Link Text](URL &quot;Title&quot;) Title is optional. Code: This is [an example](http://example.com/ &quot;Title&quot;) inline link. [This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute. Preview: This is an example inline link. This link has no title attribute. If you’re referring to a local resource on the same server, you can use relative paths: Code: See my [About](/about/) page for details. Preview: See my About page for details. ReferenceYou could predefine link references. Format like this: [id]: URL &quot;Title&quot; Title is also optional. And the you refer the link, format like this: [Link Text][id] Code: [id]: http://example.com/ &quot;Optional Title Here&quot; This is [an example][id] reference-style link. Preview: This is an example reference-style link. That is: Square brackets containing the link identifier (not case sensitive, optionally indented from the left margin using up to three spaces); followed by a colon; followed by one or more spaces (or tabs); followed by the URL for the link; The link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets. optionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses. The following three link definitions are equivalent: Code: [foo]: http://example.com/ &quot;Optional Title Here&quot; [foo]: http://example.com/ &apos;Optional Title Here&apos; [foo]: http://example.com/ (Optional Title Here) [foo]: &lt;http://example.com/&gt; &quot;Optional Title Here&quot; Uses an empty set of square brackets, the link text itself is used as the name. Code: [Google]: http://google.com/ [Google][] Preview: Google EmphasisHTML Tags: &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis. One delimiter will be &lt;em&gt;; *double delimiters will be &lt;strong&gt;. Code: *single asterisks* _single underscores_ **double asterisks** __double underscores__ Preview: single asterisks single underscores double asterisks double underscores But if you surround an * or _ with spaces, it’ll be treated as a literal asterisk or underscore. You can backslash escape it: Code: \\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\\* Preview: *this text is surrounded by literal asterisks* CodeHTML Tag: &lt;code&gt; Wraps it with backtick quotes (`). Code: Use the `printf()` function. Preview: Use the printf() function. To include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters: Code: ``There is a literal backtick (`) here.`` Preview: There is a literal backtick (`) here. The backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces — one after the opening, one before the closing. This allows you to place literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code span: Code: A single backtick in a code span: `` ` `` A backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` `` Preview: A single backtick in a code span: ` A backtick-delimited string in a code span: `foo` ImagesHTML Tag: &lt;img /&gt; Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax for links, allowing for two styles: inline and reference. InlineInline image syntax looks like this: ![Alt text](URL &quot;Title&quot;) Title is optional. Code: ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg) ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg &quot;Optional title&quot;) Preview: That is: An exclamation mark: !; followed by a set of square brackets, containing the alt attribute text for the image; followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional title attribute enclosed in double or single quotes. ReferenceReference-style image syntax looks like this: ![Alt text][id] Code: [img id]: url/to/image &quot;Optional title attribute&quot; ![Alt text][img id] Preview: StrikethroughHTML Tag: &lt;del&gt; It’s an extension. GFM adds syntax to strikethrough text. Code:1~~Mistaken text.~~ Preview: Mistaken text. MiscellaneousAutomatic LinksMarkdown supports a shortcut style for creating “automatic” links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. Code: &lt;http://example.com/&gt; &lt;address@example.com&gt; Preview: http://example.com/ &#x61;&#100;&#100;&#x72;&#x65;&#x73;&#115;&#64;&#x65;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109; GFM will autolink standard URLs. Code:1https://github.com/emn178/markdown Preview: https://github.com/emn178/markdown Backslash EscapesMarkdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formatting syntax. Code: \\*literal asterisks\\* Preview: *literal asterisks* Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters: Code: \\ backslash ` backtick * asterisk _ underscore {} curly braces [] square brackets () parentheses # hash mark + plus sign - minus sign (hyphen) . dot ! exclamation mark Inline HTMLFor any markup that is not covered by Markdown’s syntax, you simply use HTML itself. There’s no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you’re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use the tags. Code: This is a regular paragraph. &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Foo&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; This is another regular paragraph. Preview: This is a regular paragraph. Foo This is another regular paragraph. Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level HTML tags. Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax is processed within span-level tags.
